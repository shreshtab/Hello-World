UPDATE(11/12):

It's been almost a year. Looking back, I wish I did things differently. I wish I didn't waste so much time. But it's time to look forward and see how I can do better. I think I have a better mindset, and have optimized learning around my crazy work schedule. Is this uploading? Yes it is! I've integrated VS Code with GitHub! Testing a pull request... Logged into my account... Another one!!

Good day,

This marks the beginning of my coding journey. As part of my plans for 2019 and the future, I have decided to teach myself how to code by utilizing a variety of online resources. Looking forward to learning a lot!

Best,
Shreshta
